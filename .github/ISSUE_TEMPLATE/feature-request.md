### Feature Request

Provide a brief explanation of what the feature is, what it does, and what it doesn’t include.

Example: Add a toggle for Dark Mode, allowing users to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode. This will reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments, and improve usability for users who prefer darker themes. This does not include a full theme system.

### Current Pains

Describe the problems users face using stories:
- As a ***user role***, I struggle with ***problem*** because ***reason***.
- As a ***user role***, I find it frustrating that ***pain point***, leading to ***negative impact***.

Examples:
- As a nighttime user, I struggle with a bright UI because it causes eye strain in low-light conditions.
- As a mobile user with an OLED screen, I find it frustrating that the UI is always in Light Mode, leading to faster battery drain.

### Future Gains

Describe how users will benefit using stories:
- As a ***user role***, I want ***goal*** so that ***benefit***.

Examples:
- As a user, I want to toggle Dark Mode so that I can reduce eye strain and work comfortably at night.
- As a mobile user, I want a battery-efficient UI so that I can extend my device’s battery life.

### Acceptance Criteria

Define pass/fail conditions using Given-When-Then. Include multiple scenarios if applicable:
- Scenario Title:
  - Given ***context***;
  - When ***action***;
  - Then ***outcome***.

Example:
- Activate Dark Mode:
  - Given a user is in the settings menu;
  - When they toggle the "Dark Mode" switch;
  - Then the UI should switch to a dark-themed interface.
- Load Images Unchanged:
  - Given Dark Mode is active;
  - When a page containing images is loaded;
  - Then the images should display without any changes.

### Additional Notes

Include any relevant context, dependencies, open questions, or considerations for implementation.
